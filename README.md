## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jose! I'm currently studying my MSc in Economics and Finance at [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es/) in Madrid, Spain. Before taking on the big city, I completed my undergrad in Economics at [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx) in my hometown, [Santander](https://turismo.santander.es/en/what-to-do/travelling-around-the-city).

I like using Râ€”though, as every economist knows, sometimes you have to tango with Stata. Every now and then I also use Matlab when I pretend to be a macroeconomist.
